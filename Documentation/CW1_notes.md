## Target Audience..

The soon-to-be developed web-based app, will have the characteristics of an interactive dashboard and will be accessible
to everyone. However, during the kick-off of the project, the IFP team has identified three different possible groups of
target audience. Considering the information that will be provided on the app, the first group of target audience can be
identified in the potential entrepreneurs wanting to start a business. However, as mentioned before, the team also hopes
that the app will be used by local administrative authorities to help them realize the possible areas of improvement to
increase entrepreneurial attractiveness. Finally, as the app will be accessible to anyone, the team expects it to become
a benchmark for students or professionals interested in the research field. Considering the three groups of target
audience, three different personas have been developed.

#### Persona 1: Potential Entrepreneurs

## Questions to be answered using the dataset

Considering the problem statement and the target audience previously defined, the following questions should be answered
using the dataset. The main question to be answered would be:

- Which country represents the best option to start a business in terms of costs, time and procedures required?

Along with the main question, there are multiple subquestions that are more specific:

- What is the relation between income group and starting a business score?
- How have the costs, time and procedures required for starting a business changed over time with respect to gender and
  geographical region?
- Which is the geographical region that offers the best options for starting a business?
- Which countries share similar scores for different starting business indicators?
- How many countries have had more than 50% reduction in one or more indicators' values?
- What differences can be found between indicators for countries in specific geographical regions?

While the main question is of interest for every group of target audience, the subquestions are more specific to some
groups. For example, the last one could be of interest for the target audience groups represented by the personas 2 and 3. 
On the other hand, the third question could be of interest for an entrepreneur (persona 1).
